This project involves the development of many services and functionalities alonside the careful selection and assembly of hardware components for the prototype, followed by the integration of both of the to get the resulting prototype.
The aim is to integrate smart refrigerator features into a regular one by making use of an external
device, just as a Chromecast turns a regular TV into a Smart TV.
This solution allows keeping record of products and their expiration dates, making groceries and
meal planning easier.
It also offers additional functionalities such as alerting the user when any of the expiration dates
are approaching or suggesting recipes that can be prepared with the available ingredients using
AI.

In this repository, you will find both the project documentation to provide further information and the YouTube link to the video demo showcasing the functionality of the prototype.
